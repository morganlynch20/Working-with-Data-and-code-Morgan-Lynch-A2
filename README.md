Tunepad Music Compositions Project:

Explain project:
The Project is created using Tunepad, Tunepad is a a Python-based platform for music composition and coding. The project consists of three unique musical compositions, each crafted to explore different musical techniques, genres, or styles, while also demonstrating coding skills in TunePad. TunePad was selected due to its integration of music and Python programming, making it an ideal environment for experimenting with musical creativity and coding concepts. The project is also part of a learning journey to enhance code and data literacy.



Technology:
Python- Version 3( Tunepad)
Tunepad platform
Web browser

Features:
3 distinct musical compositions

Setup/How to use the technology:
User will need to make an account on Tunepad to access the compositions, 


User can listen to the project by pressing the play button as shown below:

Compositions:

Composition 1:
Description: original piece using more classical elements such as keys
Python Concepts Used: Simple coding used as first composition was slightly simpler, beats duration adjusted slightly.

Composition 2:
Description: pop inspired composition
Python Concepts Used: More complex coding with some loops, rests and fast forward features.

Composition 3: 
Description: Techno/ Trance composition
Python Concepts Used: [Describe relevant coding concepts]



Problem or Challenge Addressed:
This project aims to explore and experiement with Tunepad's different algorithmic functions in order to create different compositions in genre and style with different rhythms and harmonies.


Usage:
Running Code: User can access or listen to the code by pressing the play button in the top right of the site/screen. 


Reflection and Learning Outcomes:
This project has been an exploration of how coding and music intersect, providing a platform to experiment with Tunepad's coding environment for creative expression. By applying coding principles to music, it allows for users to undertand the variety of spectrum of features on Tunepad in the purpose for code literacy.


Project status:
Project is: complete


Room for improvement:
Adding more complex features to the different compositions e.g more rewind or fast forward, rests, and extending length of compositions. 



Acknowledgements:
This project was inspired by in class experimentation and Tunepad pre-existing tutorials.
