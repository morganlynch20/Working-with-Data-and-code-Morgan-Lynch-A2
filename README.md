Project Overview
This project showcases three distinct compositions, each created to address a specific artistic challenge. TunePad was selected due to its integration of music and Python programming, making it an ideal environment for experimenting with musical creativity and coding concepts. The project is also part of a learning journey to enhance code and data literacy.

Compositions
Composition 1

Description: [Briefly describe what this composition sounds like and its inspiration]
Musical Techniques Used: [List any specific music theory elements, such as melody, harmony, rhythm, etc.]
Python Concepts Used: [Describe relevant coding concepts, e.g., loops, conditionals, functions]
Composition 2

Description: [Briefly describe what this composition sounds like and its inspiration]
Musical Techniques Used: [List any specific music theory elements]
Python Concepts Used: [Describe relevant coding concepts]
Composition 3

Description: [Briefly describe what this composition sounds like and its inspiration]
Musical Techniques Used: [List any specific music theory elements]
Python Concepts Used: [Describe relevant coding concepts]
Problem or Challenge Addressed
This project aims to [explain any practical or artistic challenges your compositions address, such as exploring musical genres, rhythms, or harmonies, or focusing on coding principles like structure, readability, or efficiency].

Getting Started
Prerequisites
TunePad Account: You will need an account on TunePad to access and edit the compositions.
Basic Python Knowledge: Familiarity with Python is helpful to understand the coding aspects of the compositions.
Installation
Visit TunePad and log in or create a free account.
Open each composition in TunePad by copying the code into a new project.
Usage
Modifying Compositions: You can adjust musical elements such as tempo, pitch, and rhythm in TunePad by editing the Python code.
Running Code: Press "Run" in the TunePad environment to play each composition.
Reflection and Learning Outcomes
This project has been an exploration of how coding and music intersect, providing a platform to learn about programming structures and creative expression. By applying coding principles to music, it demonstrates the versatility of Python and supports the development of skills in both composition and code literacy.

Future Improvements
Some possible future improvements include:

Adding user interactivity, such as letting listeners alter the tempo or key.
Expanding compositions with more complex musical patterns.
Integrating visualizations to enhance the listening experience.
